### [2026-03-03] - Cyril Gabriele

#### What
- Rebuilt `src/data/playground/data_insights.ipynb` into a full Prudential EDA playbook covering feature semantics, structural checks, missingness analysis, cardinality scans, distribution stats, target relationships, redundancy checks, and optional matplotlib plots.

#### Why
- Provide every teammate with an accurate, self-serve overview of the dataset along with deeper diagnostics aligned to the 30%/50% missingness guidance cited in recent literature.

#### Remarks
- Install `matplotlib` if you plan to run the optional plotting section.
